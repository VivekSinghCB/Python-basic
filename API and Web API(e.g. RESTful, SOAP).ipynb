    " # Client-server architecture: The client and server are separated, allowing them to evolve independently.\n",

    "   # Cacheable: Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance.\n",
    "   # Uniform interface: RESTful services use a uniform interface consisting of resources, HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and hypermedia links.\n",
